## Introduction

For an upcoming privacy related OpenBSD, i needed to setup an access to an OpenBSD mirror both from a Tor Hidden service and I2P.
The server does not contain any data, it only acts as a proxy fetch files from an random existing OpenBSD mirror. So it does not waste any bandwidth mirroring everything.
The server doesn't have the storage required anyway. There's a little cache to keep most requested files locally.

[Get informed about I2P Protocol](https://geti2p.net/en/about/intro)

[Or Tor Protocol](https://spec.torproject.org/tor-spec/index.html)

{/* 
```bash
# Pagefind must index the site to function
npm run build
``` */}

It is only useful if you can not reach OpenBSD mirrors, or if you really need to hide your network activity. Tor or I2P will be much slower than connecting to a mirror using HTTP(s).

However, as they exist now, let me explain how to start using them.

---

## Tor

Using a client with tor proxy enabled, you can reach the following address to download installers or sets.

[Here's an OpenBSD onion mirror](http://kdzlr6wcf5d23chfdwvfwuzm6rstbpzzefkpozp7kjeugtpnrixldxqd.onion/pub/OpenBSD/)

If you want to install or update your packages from tor, you can use the onion address in  ```/etc/installurl```
However, it will not work for ```sysupgrade``` and ```syspatch```, and you need to export the variable in your environment to make **pkg_** programs able to use the mirror.
```bash
FETCH_CMD="/usr/local/bin/curl -L -s -q -N -x socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050"
```
To make sysupgrade or syspatch able to use the onion address, you need to have the program torsocks installed, and patch the script to use `torsocks`:

**Sysupgrade** 
```bash
sed -i 's,ftp -N,/usr/local/bin/torsocks &,' /usr/sbin/sysupgrade 
```
**Syspatch** 
```bash
sed -i 's,ftp -N,/usr/local/bin/torsocks &,' /usr/sbin/syspatch
```

These patches will have to be reapplied after each sysupgrade run.

## I2P
If you have a client with i2p proxy enabled, you can reach the following address to download installers or sets.

[OpenBSD mirror over I2P](http://2st32tfsqjnvnmnmy3e5o5y5hphtgt4b2letuebyv75ohn2w5umq.b32.i2p:8081/pub/OpenBSD/)

If you want to install or update your packages from i2p, install the i2pd package with `pkg_add i2pd`, 
 edit the file `/etc/i2pd/i2pd.conf` to `set notransit = true` except if you want to act as an i2p relay (high cpu/bandwidth consumption).

Replace the file` /etc/i2pd/tunnels.conf` by the following content (or adapt your current tunnels.conf if you configured it earlier):

```bash
[MIRROR]
type = client
address = 127.0.0.1
port = 8080
destination = 2st32tfsqjnvnmnmy3e5o5y5hphtgt4b2letuebyv75ohn2w5umq.b32.i2p
destinationport = 8081
keys = mirror.dat
```
Now, enable and start i2pd with` rcctl enable i2pd && rcctl start i2pd`.

After a few minutes to let i2pd establish tunnels, you should be able to browse the mirror over i2p using the address http://127.0.0.1:8080/. You can configure the port 8080 to another you prefer by modifying the file tunnels.conf.

You can use the address http://127.0.0.1:8080/pub/OpenBSD/ in` /etc/installurl` to automatically use the I2P mirror for installing/updating packages, or keeping your system up to date with syspatch/sysupgrade.

Note: from experience the I2P mirror works fine to install packages, but did not play well with fw_update, syspatch and sysupgrade, maybe because they use ftp command that seems to easily drop the connection. Downloading the files locally using a proper HTTP client supporting transfer resume would be better. On the other hand, this issue may be related to the current attack the I2P network is facing as of the time of writing (May 2024).

## Firmware mirror

OpenBSD pulls firmware from a different server than the regular mirrors, the address is http://firmware.openbsd.org/firmware/, the files on this server are signed packages, they can be installed using fw_update $file.

Both i2p and tor hidden service hostname can be reused, you only have to change` /pub/OpenBSD/ `by` /firmware/ `to browse the files.

The proxy server does not cache any firmware, it directly proxy to the genuine firmware web server. They are on a separate server for legal matter, it seems to be a grey area.

---

## Disable firmware.openbsd.org

For maximum privacy, you need to neutralize `firmware.openbsd.org` DNS lookup using a hosts entry. This is important because `fw_update` is automatically used after a system upgrade (as of 2024).

In` /etc/hosts` add the line:

```bash
127.0.0.9 firmware.openbsd.org
```

The IP in the snippet above will avoid fw_update to try to connect to a local web server if any.

It's the same way the popular cracks works. We redirect to a proxy who simulate a licence key server.

---

## Tor access

If you use tor, it is complicated to patch `fw_update` to use torsocks, the best method is to download the firmware manually.

[Here's an onion address](http://kdzlr6wcf5d23chfdwvfwuzm6rstbpzzefkpozp7kjeugtpnrixldxqd.onion/firmware/)

---

## I2P access

If you use I2P, you can reuse the tunnel configuration described in the I2P section and pass the full url to `fw_update`

```bash
# release users
fw_update -p http://127.0.0.1:8080/firmware/$(uname -r)/

# snapshot users
fw_update -p http://127.0.0.1:8080/firmware/snapshots/
```
Or you can browse the I2P url using an http client with the i2p proxy to download the firmware manually.
