## Introduction

For an upcoming privacy related OpenBSD, i needed to setup an access to an OpenBSD mirror both from a Tor Hidden service and I2P.
The server does not contain any data, it only acts as a proxy fetch files from an random existing OpenBSD mirror. So it does not waste any bandwidth mirroring everything.
The server doesn't have the storage required anyway. There's a little cache to keep most requested files locally.

[Get informed about I2P Protocol](https://geti2p.net/en/about/intro)

[Or Tor Protocol](https://spec.torproject.org/tor-spec/index.html)
Tor
```bash
# Pagefind must index the site to function
npm run build
```

When developing you can continue to use `npm run dev` and Pagefind will use the index from the last available build.
